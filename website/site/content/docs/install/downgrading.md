# Downgrading

{% warningbubble(title="Note") %}
Downgrading is currently not supported!

It is not safe to install a previous version, because the database
will most likely not be compatible. Therefore, it is recommended to
take a backup of the database before upgrading.
{% end %}



Should something not work out as expected, you need to restore the
backup and then go back to the previous version.

If you need to downgrade after running for a while, create an issue or
meet on matrix/gitter. We should be able to find a way.
