# Ds4e

If you use Emacs you might find the
[ds4e](https://github.com/docspell/ds4e) project useful. It provides a
few packages to use Docspell from within Emacs.

It is implemented as a wrapper to the [cli](@/docs/tools/cli.md) tool,
which must be installed first.

## Features

The ds4e is a collection of Emacs packages that provide mainly
integrations into other Emacs packages, like mu4e, dired or dashboard.

The `ds4e-search` package allows to search and view documents.

Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/docspell/ds4e) for
details.
