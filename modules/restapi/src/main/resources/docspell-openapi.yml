        Upload a file to docspell for processing. The id is a *source
        id* configured by a collective. Files are submitted for
        processing which eventually resuts in an item in the inbox of
        the corresponding collective.

        The request must be a `multipart/form-data` request, where the
        first part has name `meta`, is optional and may contain upload
        metadata as JSON. Checkout the structure `ItemUploadMeta` at
        the end if it is not shown here. Other parts specify the
        files. Multiple files can be specified, but at least on is
        required.

        The upload meta data can be used to tell, whether multiple
        files are one item, or if each file should become a single
        item. By default, each file will be a one item.

        Submits a job that will find all pdf files that have not been
        converted and converts them using the ocrmypdf tool (if
        enabled). This tool has been added in version 0.9.0 and so
        older files can be "migrated" this way, or maybe after
        enabling the tool.

        The task finds all files of the current collective and submits
        task for each file to convert. These tasks are submitted with
        a low priority so that normal processing can still proceed.

        The body of the request should be empty.

        attachments are *not* resolved. The results will always
        contain an empty list for item tags and attachments. Use
        `/searchWithTags` to also retrieve all tags and a list of
        attachments of an item.

        The `fulltext` field can be used to restrict the results by
        using full-text search in the documents contents.

        The customfields used in the search query are allowed to be
        specified by either field id or field name. The values may
        contain the wildcard `*` at beginning or end.

        Search for items by only using the full-text search index.

        Unlike the other search routes, this one only asks the
        full-text search index and returns only one group that
        contains the results in the same order as given from the
        index. Most full-text search engines use an ordering that
        reflect the relevance wrt the search term.

        The other search routes always order the results by some
        property (the item date) and thus the relevance ordering is
        destroyed when using the full-text search.

        Change properties of a custom field.

        Changing the label has no further impliciations, since it is
        only used for displaying. The name and type on the other hand
        have consequences: name must be unique and the type determines
        how the value is stored internally.

    ItemUploadMeta:
      description: |
        Meta information for an item upload. The user can specify some
        structured information with a binary file.

        Additional metadata is not required. However, if there is some
        specified, you have to specifiy whether the corresponding
        files should become one single item or if an item is created
        for each file.

        A direction can be given, `Incoming` is used if not specified.

        A folderId can be given, the item is placed into this folder
        after creation.

        The `fileFilter` is an optional glob for filtering files to
        import. Only applicable if archive files are uploaded. It
        applies to all of them. For example, to only import pdf files
        when uploading e-mails, use `*.pdf`. If the pattern doesn't
        contain a slash `/`, then it is applied to all file names.
        Otherwise it is applied to the complete path in the archive
        (useful for zip files). Note that the archive file itself is
        always saved completely, too.

        The `tags` input allows to provide tags that should be applied
