      description: |
        Upload a file to docspell for processing. The id is a *source
        id* configured by a collective. Files are submitted for
        processing which eventually resuts in an item in the inbox of
        the corresponding collective.

        The request must be a `multipart/form-data` request, where the
        first part has name `meta`, is optional and may contain upload
        metadata as JSON. Checkout the structure `ItemUploadMeta` at
        the end if it is not shown here. Other parts specify the
        files. Multiple files can be specified, but at least on is
        required.

        The upload meta data can be used to tell, whether multiple
        files are one item, or if each file should become a single
        item. By default, each file will be a one item.
