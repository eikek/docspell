    This is the remote API to Docspell. Docspell is a free document
    management system focused on small groups or families.

    The routes can be divided into protected, unprotected routes and
    admin routes. The unprotected, or open routes are at `/open/*`
    while the protected routes are at `/sec/*` and admin routes are at
    `/admin/*`. Open routes don't require authenticated access and can
    be used by any user. The protected routes require an authenticated
    user. The admin routes require a special http header with a value
    from the config file. They are disabled by default, you need to
    specify a secret in order to enable admin routes.

        Upload a file to docspell for processing. The id is a *source
        id* configured by a collective. Files are submitted for
        processing which eventually resuts in an item in the inbox of
        the corresponding collective.

        The request must be a `multipart/form-data` request, where the
        first part has name `meta`, is optional and may contain upload
        metadata as JSON. Checkout the structure `ItemUploadMeta` at
        the end if it is not shown here. Other parts specify the
        files. Multiple files can be specified, but at least on is
        required.

        The upload meta data can be used to tell, whether multiple
        files are one item, or if each file should become a single
        item. By default, each file will be a one item.

        all files that have not been converted yet in this way.

        This conversion tool has been added in version 0.9.0 and so
        older files can be "migrated" this way, or maybe after
        enabling the tool (it is optional).

        The task finds all files collective and submits a task for
        each file to convert. These tasks are submitted with a low
        priority so that normal processing can still proceed.

        contains the results in the same order as given from the
        index. Most full-text search engines use an ordering that
        reflect the relevance wrt the search term.

        The other search routes always order the results by some
        property (the item date) and thus the relevance ordering is
        destroyed when using the full-text search.

    ItemUploadMeta:
      description: |
        Meta information for an item upload. The user can specify some
        structured information with a binary file.

        Additional metadata is not required. However, if there is some
        specified, you have to specifiy whether the corresponding
        files should become one single item or if an item is created
        for each file.

      properties:
        multiple:
          type: boolean
          default: true
          description: |
            If `true` (the default) each file in the upload request
            results in a separate item. If it is set to `false`, then
            all files in the request are put into a single item.

            file in Docspell and will skip processing this one if one
            is found. The check is done via the file's checksum.
        tags:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/StringList"
          description: |
            The `tags` input allows to provide tags that should be
            applied to the item being created. This only works if the
            tags already exist. It is possible to specify their ids or
            names.
        fileFilter:
          type: string
          format: glob
          description: |
            The `fileFilter` is an optional glob for filtering files
            to import. Only applicable if archive files are uploaded.
            It applies to all of them. For example, to only import pdf
            files when uploading e-mails, use `*.pdf`. If the pattern
            doesn't contain a slash `/`, then it is applied to all
            file names. Otherwise it is applied to the complete path
            in the archive (useful for zip files). Note that the
            archive file itself is always saved completely, too.
