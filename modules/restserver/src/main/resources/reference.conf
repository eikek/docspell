  # Configures OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth2 authentication. Only
  # the "Authorization Code Flow" is supported.
  #
  # Multiple authentication providers can be defined. Each is
  # configured in the array below. The `provider` block gives all
  # details necessary to authenticate agains an external OIDC or OAuth
  # provider. This requires at least two URLs for OIDC and three for
  # OAuth2. The `user-url` is only required for OIDC, if the account
  # data is to be retrieved from the user-info endpoint and not from
  # the JWT token. The access token is then used to authenticate at
  # the provider to obtain user info. Thus, it doesn't need to be
  # validated here and therefore no `sign-key` setting is needed.
  # However, if you want to extract the account information from the
  # access token, it must be validated here and therefore the correct
  # signature key and algorithm must be provided. This would save
  # another request. If the `sign-key` is left empty, the `user-url`
  # is used and must be specified. If the `sign-key` is _not_ empty,
  # the response from the authentication provider is validated using
  # this key.
  #
  # After successful authentication, docspell needs to create the
  # account. For this a username and collective name is required. The
  # username is defined by the `user-key` setting. The `user-key` is
  # used to search the JSON structure, that is obtained from the JWT
  # token or the user-info endpoint, for the login name to use. It
  # traverses the JSON structure recursively, until it finds an object
  # with that key. The first value is used.
  #
  # There are the following ways to specify how to retrieve the full
  # account id depending on the value of `collective-key`:
  #
  # - If it starts with `fixed:`, like "fixed:collective", the name
  #   after the `fixed:` prefix is used as collective as is. So all
  #   users are in the same collective.
  #
  # - If it starts with `lookup:`, like "lookup:collective_name", the
  #   value after the prefix is used to search the JSON response for
  #   an object with this key, just like it works with the `user-key`.
  #
  # - If it starts with `account:`, like "account:ds-account", it
  #   works the same as `lookup:` only that the value is interpreted
  #   as the full account name of form `collective/login`. The
  #   `user-key` value is ignored in this case.
  #
  # If these values cannot be obtained from the response, docspell
  # fails the authentication by denying access. It is then assumed
  # that the successfully authenticated user has not enough
  # permissions to access docspell.
  #
  # Below are examples for OpenID Connect (keycloak) and OAuth2
  # (github).
