Dear Mr. Leaf,

Let me begin by thanking you for your past contributions to our Little League baseball
team. Your sponsorship aided in the purchase of ten full uniforms and several pieces of
baseball equipment for last year’s season.

Next month, our company is planning an employee appreciation pancake breakfast hon-
oring retired employees for their past years of service and present employees for their
loyalty and dedication in spite of the current difficult economic conditions.

We would like to place an order with your company for 25 pounds of pancake mix and
five gallons of maple syrup. We hope you will be able to provide these products in the
bulk quantities we require.

As you are a committed corporate sponsor and long-time associate, we hope that you
will be able to join us for breakfast on December 12, 2016.

Respectfully yours,

Derek Jeter
